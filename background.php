      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Design and Shoot was founded in 2005 by John Smith, a graphic designer with a passion for videography. John started out as a freelance designer, but soon realized that there was a need for high-quality video production in the industry. He started offering video shooting services alongside his design work, and quickly built up a reputation for excellence.</p>
      <p>In 2008, John hired his first employee, Jane Doe, a fellow designer and videographer. Together, they expanded the company's offerings and took on bigger projects. Over the years, Design and Shoot has grown to become a leading provider of graphic design and video production services, with a team of talented designers and videographers who are dedicated to delivering exceptional work.</p>
      <p>Today, Design and Shoot continues to innovate and push the boundaries of design and video production. We believe that great design and video can change the world, and we are committed to creating work that is not only visually stunning, but also meaningful and impactful.</p>
